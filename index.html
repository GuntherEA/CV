    <p>My name is Eric Gunther. I am an autodidact programmer who is learning more
       about coding and development each and every day. Within the next few years I
       hope to be working as a developer full time and my dream job would be to work on games.

    <h3>Education</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Introduction to Basic Programming - Thornton Academy</li>
      <p>
        Ever since I was little I was interested in computers. This was the first exposure
        I had to computer programming. We used REAL Basic and Alice Object Oriented Programming.
        This was by far my favorite class and I remember coming into the classroom to work on projects
        all the time during study hall. We made simple things like a web browser and some basic forms.
        For my final project I recreated the entire first level of Super Mario Brothers in Alice. That was
        a ton of fun and I wish I had that project still.
